A CUDA-accelerated fractal generator. Currently supports double pendulum simulation + mandelbrot set. In the process of adding more features to the SDL renderer and adding arbitrary precision.

## What's going on?
Unfortunately, I've decided to stop work on this project. I'd rather avoid CUDA for its lack of portability and prioritize my current GLSL WebGL shader project at [my blog's repo](https://github.com/sam-mccarthy/sam-mccarthy.github.io/), and potentially something in OpenCL, if I feel so inclined.
